# Omora

Omora Chrome extension.

## Development
The side panel UI is written in TypeScript. It presents a fixed rail on the right and a content shell on the left with a header showing the active feature name and a close button. The panel can collapse to leave only the rail visible and this state persists in `chrome.storage.local`.
